# Singer Machines 
Looking to buy a new sewing machine? Check out this transactional email template! This project allowed me explore the world of HTML Email templates and new techinques to utilize HTML & CSS. Creating email templates is different from creating a regular website and it was intersting to learn how to work within the constraints of HTML tables only. Also, it made me consider responsiveness with every section created because usually, I would work on it at the end of a project.

# What I Learned 
* Inline CSS is preferred over a seperate CSS/SCSS file
* Instead of using flex box for the navbar, table row with the categories placed in table data tags is the preferred method
* 6-Digit hex codes need to be used since they are the only codes univesally supported
